**IronLab** is suite of [WPF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation) controls providing an embeddable, interactive numerical computing environment for scientific, engineering and mathematical use.

IronLab is designed to be used with NumPy and SciPy for .NET. It comprises:

  * An embeddable interactive shell/editor with autocompletion/help (can also be used stand-alone or as a generic IronPython shell)
  * 2D and 3D interactive plotting based on WPF, DirectX and Direct2D (for faster plotting).

These can (and are!) used in various combinations to provide IronPython scripting for existing .NET applications. The .NET versions of [NumPy / SciPy](http://pytools.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=NumPy%20and%20SciPy%20for%20.Net) can be incorporated to obtain an embeddable numerical computing environment.
