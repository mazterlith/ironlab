IronPython and NumPy and SciPy for .NET come bundled in the example IronLab zip file. The bundle is largely for example purposes and it is generally recommended that the latest versions of these files be used (although I hope to keep the zip files up to date).

IronLab benefits from the following projects:
  * XamlToys
  * AvalonEdit
  * WPG

Many thanks to all those involved.
